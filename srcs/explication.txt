pthread_mutex_t is just a struct that holds 2 things:

LOCK,

UNLOCK,

it is so that when a thead comes to the line, the very
first one will lock and then the other ones will have to wait
or do something else idk but they are waiting they cant pass
this line, the thread that has locked it can now do his things
by following the rest of the code and then once he is done
he will unlock it and another thread will come and lock it again
